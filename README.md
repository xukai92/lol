# Mastery Brain

This application aimed to help users learn how to set up their mastery page from other players (e.g. professional players).

## Usage

**Note**: It may take a while to find the result, please be patient.

## Further Work

- Analysis which mastery is best for one champion versus another.

## For Developers

In order to use your own API in this application, you need to create a file called `confidential.py` in the same folder as `api.py`, and in `confidential.py` simply set your API as `API_KEY = 'yourAPIString'`.
